# About this project

This is the first edit I'm making to the Readme file. Anyway, I decided to start this project after a long and arduous problem with a vendor of shop management software, to make a long story short, they're trying to make the entity that I work for, liable for their tax debt.

Upon further review, they have no real competition in the self-hosted shop management space. So, I'm starting one. Here's the reason why:

## My proficiencies

I decided to take on this mantle because of the following proficiencies I have:

- Experience from gigwork in Inventory Management Software
- Years of technical knowhow
- Experience developing several iterations of Ticket Auction Manager leading to [github/dbob16/tam-api](https://www.github.com/dbob16/tam-api)
- 12 years of experience providing tech support to independent mechanics
- 10 years of experience being the primary tech support contact of a vocational college, including Automotive Repair curriculums
- Possible connections in getting parts-ordering capabilities planned

## My pitfalls

The things I self-admittedly don't have a lot of experience in the following. So expect more lead time and please offer help in the following if you're inclined to do so:

- Programming in general. I know enough to throw together the most basic Python program for the task, but it probably won't be the prettiest or the fastest
- Access Control - I could stand to learn more about how to control access to certain things.

Some of the things I'm learning about the proper ways to build a networked application (using API's instead of slinging SQL traffic right onto the network) can be tracked via my progress on [github/dbob16/tam-api](https://www.github.com/dbob16/tam-api).

## The plan so far (may change)

Backend:
- FastAPI as a primary server
- MariaDB/MySQL as the database
- SQLModel to manage Schema

Frontend:
- TTK or TTKBootstrap based (I want to avoid weird dependency hells like some other solutions)
- HTML reports
- Calendar/Scheduling view report, also in HTML and maybe responsive to mobile (due to feedback from an independent shop owner)

That's it for now. Stay tuned.
